 <b>General Guidelines</b><br>

Original research papers or review articles pertaining to any aspect of the geosciences in Sri Lanka or elsewhere are welcome. However, preference will be given to papers dealing directly with Sri Lanka and those with an international interest with relevance to Sri Lanka.<br><br>

Manuscript (three copies) should be addressed to the Editors, Geological Society of Sri Lanka, c/o Department of Geology, University of Peradeniya, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka.<br><br>

Papers are accepted on the understanding that they have not been submitted or published elsewhere.<br><br>

If extra work on the manuscript is needed (such as figure redrafting) it will be charged to the author’s at cost.<br><br>

The average length for papers, including references and text figures, should not exceed fifteen printed papers.<br><br>

Papers will be refereed by at least two referees.<br><br>

Authors should carefully follow the format used in a previous issue.<br><br>

<b>Text</b><br><br>

Three complete copies of text, tables, figure captions, photocopies of figures and one set of original photographs should be submitted, preferably by registered post.<br><br>

Typescript must be accurate and in final format because corrections in proof stage are costly. Additions at proof stage will not be allowed.<br><br>

Typescript should be double spaced, preferably on A4 paper and with a 2.5 cm margin on each side.<br><br>

Papers should be arranged as follows: Title: brief and specific, followed by name(s) and address(es) of auth-or(s) including the email address of the corresponding author. Abstract: this must be intelligible without reference to the paper, and not more than 200 words. It should not be a mere recital of the subjects covered, but should be a condensation of the new information and interpretations in the paper. References should not be included. Main body of paper: subdivided into 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th order headings. All pages should be paginated and bear the name of the author(s). Acknowledgments: if any, to follow the main text. Tables: each typed on a separate sheet of paper. Captions: should be typed, double spaced, as a separate list and paginated separately. All illustrations are called ‘figures’ and referred to as “Fig.” in caption  and “Figure” in  text, except when in parenthesis.<br><br>

References: list all references cited in full without abbreviations, and in alphabetical order. References in the text should be by name followed by year of publication; if more than one author use ‘et al.,’’ (follow format of a previous issue or contact editors).<br><br>

<b>Illustrations</b><br><br>

The maximum printed size of illustrations is approximately 170×230 mm (full page) or 85x 230 mm (column width).<br><br>

Originals should be in black ink on good quality tracing medium or white board. All drawings should contain a metric bar scale. Lettering should be minimum of 2 mm height after reducing, so should be large enough in originals to stand reductions.<br><br>

Captions should not be written on the figures, and all empty space should, as far as possible be eliminated.<br><br>

In maps, north point and, where possible, coordinates of latitude and longitude should be marked.<br><br>

Large folded figures and maps will be accepted only after consultation with the Editors: authors may have to bear the cost of such folded insertions.<br><br>

Photographs should be sharp, glossy prints, with good contrast, and contain some form of scale. All photomicrographs should contain a metric bar scale.<br><br>

Separate parts of a single figure should be labeled a, b, c, etc. and so referred to in text and captions.<br><br>

Name(s) or author(s) and figure numbers should be written on top, right-hand corner of line drawings, and on backs of photographs on stick-on labels. Where ambiguous, tops of figures and photographs should be indicated by an arrow showing ‘top’.<br><br>

<b>References</b><br><br>

All publications cited in the text should be presented in a list of references following the text of the manuscript. Reference citation by the number system is not acceptable. The manuscript should be carefully checked to ensure that the spelling of authors’ names and dates are exactly the same in the text as in the reference list.<br><br>

In the text refer to the author’s name (without initial) and year of publication, followed – if necessary by a short reference to appropriate pages. Examples: “Since Cooray (1996) has shown that …” “This is in agreement with results obtained later (Kröner et al., 1998, pp. 12-16)”. If reference is made in the text to a publication written by more than two authors the name of the first author should be used followed by “et al.”<br><br>

Reference citations in the text should be arranged chronologically. This list of references should be arranged alphabetically on authors’ names, and chronologically per author. If an author’s name in the list is also mentioned with co-authors the following order should be used: publications of the single author, arranged according to publication dates – publications of the same author with one co-author – publications of the author with more than one co-author. Publications by the same author(s) in the same year should be listed as 1999a, 1999b, etc.<br><br>

Use the following system for arranging your references (refer a recent issue of the journal if necessary):<br><br>

</ul>
Abbreviate the titles of periodicals mentioned in the list of references, according to the International List of Periodical Title Word Abbreviations.<br><br>

In the case of publications in any language other than English, the original title is to be retained. However, the titles of publications in non-Latin alphabets should be transliterated, and a notation such as “(in Sinhala)” or “(in Japanese, with English abstract)” should be added.<br><br>

Work accepted for publication but not yet published should be referred to as “in press”.<br><br>

References concerning unpublished data and “personal communications” should not be cited in the reference list but may be mentioned in the text.<br><br>

For a web based source, provide the name(s) of the author(s), the title of the report or article, the complete web address and the month and year the site was visited for the cited information.<br><br>

<b>Tables</b><br><br>

Tables should be typed on separate sheets, not necessarily using double spacing.<br><br>

They should be designed to go across single or double column width of the Journal. Units should be given once at head of table, and tables should be enclosed within rules.<br><br>

<b>Submission of electronic files</b><br><br>

The authors are requested to submit the final text on a CD, along with a hard copy, for speedy processing of the paper for publication. The text should be prepared on PC compatible computers preferably with a recent Windows version of Microsoft Word or Word Perfect. The authors should inquire from the Editors if they wish to use other word processing programmes and/or a different type of computer giving the name and version of the programme and type of computer. Main text, list of references, table and figure legends should be stored in separate text files on the diskettes clearly indicating the file names.<br><br>

<b>Offprints and Copyright</b><br><br>

Ten copies of each paper will be provided to authors free of charge. Additional copies may be ordered by informing the Editors when submitting the final, revised manuscript.<br><br>

It is the responsibility of authors to ensure that permission is granted for reproduction of any copyright material, and that this permission is acknowledged in their papers.<br><br>
